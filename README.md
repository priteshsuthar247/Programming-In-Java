# Programming-In-Java
This repository contains the practical's performed in Programming In Java (Laboratory). The practicals are based on the syllabus of DRS. KIRAN &amp; PALLAVI PATEL GLOBAL UNIVERSITY.

<h1>Practical List</h1>
<h2>Practical-1</h2>

  [Use Cramer's rule to solve the following 2 X 2 system of linear equations for x and y: <br>

  Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the constants a, b, c, d, e, and f and the <br>
  display the solution (x =?? and y =??). If ad-bc is 0, then your program prints “The equation <br>
  has no solution". <br>
