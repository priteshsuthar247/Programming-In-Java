# Programming-In-Java
This repository contains the practical's performed in Programming In Java (Laboratory). The practicals are based on the syllabus of DRS. KIRAN &amp; PALLAVI PATEL GLOBAL UNIVERSITY.

<h1>Practical List</h1>
<h2>Practical 1</h2>
<p>
  Use Cramer's rule to solve the following 2 X 2 system of linear equations for x and y: <br>
ax + by = e, x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc) <br>
cx + dy = f, y = (af - ec)/(ad -bc) <br>
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the constants a, b, c, d, e, and f and the <br>
display the solution (x =?? and y =??). If ad-bc is 0, then your program prints â€œThe equation <br>
has no solution". <br>
Note: (1) 3.4x+50.2y=44.5 (2) 2.1x+.55y=5.9
</p>

<h2>Practical 2</h2>
<p>
  Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your <br>
  weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that <br>
  prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. <br>
  Note:- 1 pound=.45359237 Kg and 1 inch=.0254 meters 
</p>

<h2>Practical 3</h2>
<p>
   Write a program that reads a number in metres, converts it to feet, and displays the result.
</p>

<h2>Practical 4</h2>
<p>
   Write a program to check the given number is Prime or not.
