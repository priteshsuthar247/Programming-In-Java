  Use Cramer's rule to solve the following 2 X 2 system of linear equations for x and y: <br>
ax + by = e, x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc) <br>
cx + dy = f, y = (af - ec)/(ad -bc) <br>
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the constants a, b, c, d, e, and f and the <br>
display the solution (x =?? and y =??). If ad-bc is 0, then your program prints â€œThe equation <br>
has no solution". <br>
Note: (1) 3.4x+50.2y=44.5 (2) 2.1x+.55y=5.9
